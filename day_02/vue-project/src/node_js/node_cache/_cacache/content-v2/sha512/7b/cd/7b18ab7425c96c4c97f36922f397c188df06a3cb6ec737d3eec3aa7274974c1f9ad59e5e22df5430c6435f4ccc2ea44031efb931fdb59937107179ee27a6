than 80 high-quality linting rules for writing better React code.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Modern**: First-class support for TypeScript, React 19, and more.\n- **Flexible**: Increased flexibility with more granular severity control.\n- **Performant**: Built with performance in mind, optimized for large codebases.\n- **Comprehensive**: Handles complex scenarios and identifies problems that other tools might miss.\n\n## Public Packages\n\n### Modular\n\n- [`eslint-plugin-react-x`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) - Core rules (renderer-agnostic, compatible with x-platform).\n- [`eslint-plugin-react-dom`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) - DOM specific rules for React DOM.\n- [`eslint-plugin-react-web-api`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-web-api) - Rules for interacting with Web APIs.\n- [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks-extra`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-hooks-extra) - Extra React Hooks rules.\n- [`eslint-plugin-react-naming-convention`](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-naming-convention) - Naming convention rules.\n\n### All-In-One\n\n- [`@eslint-react/eslint-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint-react/eslint-plugin) - All rules and config presets from the above plugins.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev typescript-eslint @eslint-react/eslint-plugin\n```\n\n### Setup\n\n```js\n// eslint.config.js\n\n// @ts-check\nimport eslintJs from \"@eslint/js\";\nimport eslintReact from \"@eslint-react/eslint-plugin\";\nimport tseslint from \"typescript-eslint\";\n\nexport default tseslint.config({\n  files: [\"**/*.ts\", \"**/*.tsx\"],\n  extends: [\n    eslintJs.configs.recommended,\n    tseslint.configs.recommended,\n    eslintReact.configs[\"recommended-typescript\"],\n  ],\n  languageOptions: {\n    parser: tseslint.parser,\n    parserOptions: {\n      projectService: true,\n    },\n  },\n  rules: {\n    // Put rules you want to override here\n    \"@eslint-react/prefer-shorthand-boolean\": \"warn\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\n[Full Installation Guide ↗](https://eslint-react.xyz/docs/getting-started/typescript)\n\n</details>\n\n## Presets\n\n### Bare Bones\n\n- **Core** (`core`)\\\n  Enable rules for `\"react\"`.\n- **DOM** (`dom`)\\\n  Enable rules for `\"react-dom\"`.\n- **Web API** (`web-api`)\\\n  Enable rules for interacting with Web APIs.\n\n### General Purpose\n\n- **Recommended** (`recommended`)\\\n  Enforce rules that are recommended by ESLint React for general purpose React + React DOM projects.\\\n  _This preset includes the `core`, `dom`, and `web-api` presets._\n\n### TypeScript Specialized\n\n- **Recommended TypeScript** (`recommended-typescript`)\\\n  Same as the `recommended` preset but disables rules that can be enforced by TypeScript.\n\n- **Recommended Type-Checked** (`recommended-type-checked`)\\\n  Same as the `recommended-typescript` preset but enables additional rules that require type information.\n\n[Full Presets List ↗](https://eslint-react.xyz/docs/presets)\n\n## Rules\n\n[Rules Overview
